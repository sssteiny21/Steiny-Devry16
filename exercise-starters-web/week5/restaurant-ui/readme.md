Restaurant UI
==========

Difficulty - 4/5
---------

Skills
-------
- Angular Factory
- Object Oriented Programming
- MVC Architecture

Background
---------
Now that you've had some experience using constructors and prototypes in vanilla JS, you should be able to translate it over into an Angular application.  Angular excels at creating data driven applications so translating the constructors and objects you've created should be a good way to practice that.

Make sure to try to take advantage of Angular components to help keep you organized (controllers, factories, etc).  These will help you with your MVC architecture and make your application easier to develop and maintain.

Objective
-------
Create a user interface for the Restaurant Objects exercise. Display a restaurant's menu and allow users to place orders.

Requirements
---------
- When the page loads, render a restaurant with its name and menu.
- When the user clicks on a plate, they get the option to add it to their order.
- Display the user's order with total price.
- Highlight the Plates that match the user's dietary preferences.

<strong>Note</strong>: It might be a good idea to write down your design ahead of time and run it by a peer or instructor to see if it makes sound sense before beginning to implement it! Good luck and have fun!

Bonus
-------
Add your own unique customization to this exercise, such as an enhanced user interface, additional ordering options, or an expanded menu.
