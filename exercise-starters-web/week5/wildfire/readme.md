Requirements

- Copy the starter code from the refactoru-exercise-starters repo.

- When the user clicks on the Lake, it should become selected. Then, when the user clicks on any piece of #land, the clicked button should become blue. Use the Bootstrap button class that makes buttons <img src="https://ru-student-site.s3.amazonaws.com/wildfire_1.png">
- When the user clicks on the Campfire, it should become selected. Then, when the user clicks on any piece of #land, the clicked button should become red. Use the Bootstrap button class that makes buttons red.<img src="https://ru-student-site.s3.amazonaws.com/wildfire_2.png">
- When the user sets a piece of #land on fire, it should begin burning. Surrounding parcels will first turn orange, and then red. Orange parcels spread at a rate of 2 parcels per second. Red parcels spread at a rate of 1 parcel per second.<img src="https://ru-student-site.s3.amazonaws.com/wildfire_3.png">
- Making parcels into water should contain the fire. Water can't catch on fire, and fire can't jump water.<img src="https://ru-student-site.s3.amazonaws.com/wildfire_4.png">
- Add your own piece of functionality! Replace the buttons with graphical icons? Make the color of the fire increase in intensity over time? Add houses that take longer to burn down? Use your imagination and challenge yourself.
