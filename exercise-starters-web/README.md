# Exercise Starters
> This repository holds all of the starter code for the exercises you will do while being a student at RefactorU!

## Getting Started

1. Using your cloud editor (currently [Cloud 9](https://c9.io)), run the following commands:
    ```bash
    cd ~/workspace
    git clone https://github.com/RefactorU/exercise-starters.git
    ```

2. Whenever you start a new exercise, **COPY** the exercise in to a new location, e.g.:
    ```bash
    cp -r ~/workspace/exercise-starters/week1/card-flip/starter-code ~/workspace/card-flip
    ```

3. That last step is super important! If you try modifying this repository directly after cloning you will run into issues!

4. Begin the assignment and create a **BRAND NEW** repository for any given exercise under _YOUR_ username. To start a new repository, follow this guide: [Adding an existing project to GitHub using the command line.](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)
