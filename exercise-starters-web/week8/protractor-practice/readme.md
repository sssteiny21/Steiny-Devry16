# Protractor Practice

Difficulty - 4/5
---------

### Objective
Choose an exercise that you completed previously in this course. Write tests for that exercise using protractor to verify that you satisfied the requirements of that exercise.

### Requirements

#### Part I: Optimistic tests
- Write a set of tests for the exercise that assume your program will be given reasonable inputs.
- When given reasonable inputs, does your program behave properly?

#### Part II: Pessimistic tests
- Write a set of tests for the exercise that assume your program will be given bad inputs.
- When given bad inputs, does your program respond gracefully? Or does it just ignore the inputs (or worse yet, simply crashes)?
