Midterm Project Proposal
=================

Difficulty - 3/5
---------

Objective
------------
Write a proposal for an independent project which you will design and implement over about 4 days. The purpose of this proposal is to formulate your idea and articulate the requirements of your application.

You will be asked to present your proposal to instructors in an informal setting. We can help identify requirements/dependencies that are underdeveloped as well as areas that may be beyond the scope of a 4-day project. Think of this proposal as a rough draft: something you can get feedback on and revise before you start your project.

This is also a great opportunity to build something for your portfolio to show to employers!

Your project must fit under one of the following high-level categories:

- A minimum viable product that solves a problem for a specific group of users.
- A technology experiment that shows off a unique feature or combination of technologies.

In your proposal, you will be asked probing questions according to whichever category your idea falls under. If you have an idea for a potential product, you will be asked what type of users the product is for and how your product attempts to solve a problem for them in a unique way. If you have an idea for using CSS3 transformations, animation, MVC, canvas, or other experimental technologies, you will be asked what features you are attempting to demonstrate.
