Procedural Generation
===========

Skills
--------
- Creating Algorithms
- Data Structure

Background
--------

Algorithms are an important part of development.  Often much of a business or app's value is driven from the algorithm powering it.  In this exercise you will be building an application that procedurally generates floor plans for a house.

Objective
-------
You run a own a real estate development firm and need to have a way to generate new and exciting floor plans.  Instead of a manual editor to create new floors plans by hand, you want more of a russian roulette approach - something that will give you a new floor plan each time it's run.

Room Types
-----------
- Bedroom
- Bathroom
- Hallway
- Living Room
- Kitchen
- Patio

Requirements
----------
- Create an algorithm to generate floor plans.  These floor plans must follow certain conditions :
    - All rooms can possibly have up to 4 connections (North, South, East, West)
    - Must use at least one `Bedroom`, `Bathroom`, and `Kitchen`.  These are the bare necessities to have in a house.
    - `Hallway`s can only connect with one other `Hallway`.
    - `Bathroom`s may only be connected to `Bedroom`s, `Hallway`s, and `Living Rooms`.
    - `Bathroom`s cannot have more than 2 connections.
    - Only one `Patio` can be part of the floor plan and can only be connected to a `Living Room` or `Bedroom`.
    - A `Living Room` may be connected to any other room.
    - A floorplan should have between 3-8 rooms.


Bonus
-----------
Make a front-end to visually represent the floor plan
